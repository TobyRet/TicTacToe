## Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe written in Java for the console.

Currently there are two game modes.

<em>Multi player</em> allows two players to play against each other.

<em>Single Player</em> mode allows a single player to play against the computer. The computer has access to some pre-defined game strategies which it will attempt to execute before defaulting to a random move. Two game strategies are currently in place, and there are a few more that still need to be added (such as blocking an opponents move).
