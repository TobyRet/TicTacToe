## Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe written in Java for the console. It has been rewritten a number of times ... each time I have tried to make the code cleaner.

Currently there is one game mode:

<em>Multi player</em> allows two players to play against each other.

A single player mode (playing against the computer will be dded shortly).
